# Basic Chat in Java

Simple chat in Java. This is not meant to be a showcase of anything. I'm simply making this for fun when I have time to work on it.

### Quick Start

Compile the two java files into java bytecode:
```console
$ javac client.java
$ javac server.java
```

Run the server program, then run the client program:
```console
$ java server
```
```console
$ java client
```
